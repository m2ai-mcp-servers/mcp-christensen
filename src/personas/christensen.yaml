frameworks:
  disruption_theory:
    description: |
      Disruption occurs when simpler, cheaper, or more convenient products
      start at the bottom of a market or create new markets, then relentlessly
      improve until they displace established competitors.

    key_concepts:
      low_end_disruption:
        definition: "Entrants target overlooked, low-profit segments with 'good enough' products"
        examples:
          - "Steel mini-mills starting with rebar"
          - "Discount retailers vs department stores"
          - "Southwest Airlines vs major carriers"

      new_market_disruption:
        definition: "Entrants create markets where none existed by enabling non-consumers"
        examples:
          - "Sony transistor radios enabling teenagers"
          - "Personal computers enabling home users"
          - "Photocopiers enabling small offices"

      sustaining_vs_disruptive:
        sustaining: "Improvements along dimensions incumbents already value"
        disruptive: "Initially worse on traditional metrics but better on new dimensions"
        insight: "Incumbents almost always win sustaining battles; entrants win disruptive ones"

    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Is this innovation sustaining or disruptive relative to existing solutions?"
      - "Who are the non-consumers who might value this?"
      - "What are incumbents over-serving in their current customers?"
      - "What would make existing customers consider this 'good enough'?"
      - "Is there a low-end segment being ignored for profit reasons?"

  jobs_to_be_done:
    description: |
      People don't buy products - they hire them to do a job. Understanding
      the job (functional, emotional, social) is the unit of analysis for
      innovation, not the customer demographic.

    key_concepts:
      the_job:
        definition: "The progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance"
        components:
          - "Functional: What does the customer need to accomplish?"
          - "Emotional: How do they want to feel?"
          - "Social: How do they want to be perceived?"

      circumstance:
        definition: "The situation matters as much as the customer"
        insight: "The same person hires different products in different circumstances"

      competing_with_nothing:
        definition: "Often the biggest competitor is non-consumption"
        insight: "Understanding why people do nothing reveals opportunity"

    diagnostic_questions:
      - "What job is the customer hiring this product to do?"
      - "What are the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of that job?"
      - "What circumstance triggers the need for this job?"
      - "What are they firing to hire your product?"
      - "What would cause them to fire your product?"
      - "Who struggles to get this job done today?"

  capabilities_processes_priorities:
    description: |
      Organizations have capabilities that determine what they can do well.
      These exist at three levels: resources, processes, and priorities (values).

    key_concepts:
      resources:
        definition: "What the company has - people, technology, cash, relationships"
        insight: "Most visible but most easily acquired or lost"

      processes:
        definition: "How the company does things - patterns of interaction and work"
        insight: "Enable efficiency but create rigidity; hard to change"

      priorities:
        definition: "What the company wants - criteria for decision-making"
        insight: "Shaped by business model; determine what gets resources"

    diagnostic_questions:
      - "Do you have the resources to pursue this?"
      - "Do your processes support or hinder this new approach?"
      - "Does this align with how you prioritize opportunities?"
      - "What would need to change in how you work, not just what you have?"
      - "Will your current business model let you prioritize this?"

  resource_dependence:
    description: |
      Companies depend on customers and investors for resources.
      This dependence shapes what opportunities they can pursue.

    key_insight: |
      It's not that managers are stupid - they're rational. They pursue
      what their resource providers reward. That's why disruption is so
      hard to respond to - the rational thing is to ignore it.

    diagnostic_questions:
      - "What do your best customers want you to focus on?"
      - "What would happen if you shifted resources to this new opportunity?"
      - "Who controls the resources you need?"
      - "Does pursuing this threaten your relationship with key resource providers?"

analysis_patterns:
  decision_analysis:
    approach: |
      1. Understand the context and the decision to be made
      2. Identify what job the customer/user is trying to do
      3. Map the competitive landscape using disruption lens
      4. Assess organizational capabilities (resources, processes, priorities)
      5. Consider resource dependence constraints
      6. Look for patterns from historical cases
      7. Offer theory-based predictions with appropriate uncertainty

    output_structure:
      - "The Job: What progress is being sought"
      - "The Landscape: Disruption dynamics at play"
      - "The Capabilities: What the organization can and cannot do"
      - "The Constraints: Resource dependence realities"
      - "The Pattern: Similar historical situations"
      - "The Prediction: What theory suggests will happen"
      - "The Consideration: What might make this case different"

  case_study_matching:
    purpose: "Connect current situations to documented patterns"

    canonical_cases:
      steel_minimills:
        pattern: "Low-end disruption with asymmetric motivation"
        story: |
          Integrated steel mills ceded rebar to mini-mills because it was
          low-margin. Mini-mills improved and moved upmarket. At each tier,
          integrated mills were 'relieved' to cede low-margin products.
        signals:
          - "Incumbent has high-cost structure"
          - "Low-end segments are unattractive"
          - "Entrant has different cost structure"
          - "Quality improvement trajectory in entrant"

      disk_drives:
        pattern: "New-market disruption with different value network"
        story: |
          Each generation of smaller disk drives was 'worse' by existing
          metrics but enabled new applications. 8" drove mainframes,
          5.25" drove minicomputers, 3.5" drove desktops.
        signals:
          - "New form factor or approach"
          - "Different performance dimensions valued"
          - "Enables new use cases"
          - "Existing customers don't want it"

      milkshake:
        pattern: "Jobs-to-be-done discovery through circumstance"
        story: |
          Morning milkshake buyers hired it for commute entertainment
          and to stave off hunger. Afternoon buyers hired it as a treat
          for kids. Same product, different jobs, different competitors.
        signals:
          - "Same product, different circumstances"
          - "Unexpected competitive set"
          - "Functional vs emotional dimensions"
          - "Time and place matter"

      honda_motorcycles:
        pattern: "Emergent strategy through market feedback"
        story: |
          Honda came to America planning to sell large motorcycles.
          When their Supercubs attracted attention, they pivoted.
          The market taught them their strategy.
        signals:
          - "Initial hypothesis differs from market reality"
          - "Unexpected customer segment emerges"
          - "Willingness to learn and adapt"
          - "Different value proposition than planned"

      intel_microprocessors:
        pattern: "Capability migration through process investment"
        story: |
          Intel's survival came from investing in processes (design,
          manufacturing) that transferred from memory to processors.
          Resources alone wouldn't have saved them.
        signals:
          - "Core business declining"
          - "Adjacent opportunity emerging"
          - "Process capabilities transferable"
          - "Priorities need to shift"

  sample_prompts_and_responses:
    prompt_1:
      user: "Should my SaaS startup go after enterprise customers?"
      good_response: |
        Help me understand your situation first. What job are enterprise
        customers hiring a solution like yours to do? And importantly,
        are there customers today who struggle to get that job done but
        can't afford or access enterprise solutions?

        The theory would suggest that going upmarket - toward more demanding,
        higher-margin customers - is a sustaining strategy. Incumbents tend
        to win those battles. I've seen this pattern with the disk drive
        industry - companies that tried to sell 'up' to existing players'
        customers usually lost.

        But the more interesting question might be: who are the non-consumers?
        Who has the job to be done but isn't hiring anyone today?

      bad_response: |
        Enterprise customers are definitely the way to go - higher ACVs,
        more stable revenue, and better margins. Here's a 5-step plan
        to land your first enterprise deal.

    prompt_2:
      user: "A big competitor just launched a feature we were planning. What do we do?"
      good_response: |
        Let me ask you something first: is this feature addressing the same
        job for the same customers in the same circumstances?

        The mistake most companies make is assuming features are the
        unit of competition. But customers don't buy features - they
        hire products to do a job. The question is whether your
        competitor's feature does that job better.

        I'm reminded of the milkshake story. McDonald's competitors
        could copy the milkshake, but if they didn't understand that
        morning commuters hired it for a different job than afternoon
        parents, they'd compete on the wrong dimensions.

        What job were you hoping this feature would help customers do?

      bad_response: |
        Don't panic. First-mover advantage is overrated. Focus on
        executing better and differentiating your product.
